**Abstract:**   
We present a new model for calcium oscillations based on experiments in
hepatocytes. The model considers feedback inhibition on the initial agonist
receptor complex by calcium and activated phospholipase C, as well as receptor
type-dependent self-enhanced behavior of the activated G(alpha) subunit. It is
able to show simple periodic oscillations and periodic bursting, and it is the
first model to display chaotic bursting in response to agonist stimulations.
Moreover, our model offers a possible explanation for the differences in
dynamic behavior observed in response to different agonists in hepatocytes.
